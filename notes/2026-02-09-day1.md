\## JDK vs JVM vs JRE

\- JDK (Java Development Kit): tools to develop Java apps (javac, debugger) + includes JRE.

\- JRE (Java Runtime Environment): runtime to run Java apps (libraries + JVM).

\- JVM (Java Virtual Machine): executes Java bytecode and manages memory (heap/stack, GC).



\## What is main()

\- main() is the entry point where the Java program starts executing.



\## What is a method

\- A method is a reusable block of code that performs a task and can return a result.



\## for vs while

\- for is preferred when the number of iterations is known; while is preferred when the loop depends on a condition and iterations are unknown.
